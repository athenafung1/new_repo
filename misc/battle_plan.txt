i dont know how people normally make it executable and beautiful

ideally this program works for multiple universities, but no idea how to store that stuff separately
also have to maybe figure out quarter vs semester

also how do u plan to do the user interface? we could just go with the yolo console output or do c++ gui

1. main class
2. class to handle reading/writing to file (maybe split into 2 classes)
3. class to figure out how do we store data in file
4. class to read file and convert it to understandable classes
